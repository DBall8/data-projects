# Uber launch cities and dates

This folder contains data related to the dates in which Uber began operating in U.S. cities and abroad.

The original dataset was compiled by [Frank Bi](http://twitter.com/frankiebi) @ [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/12/11/ubers-global-expansion/) and released with permission by Forbes.

## Note

Data in this spreadsheet was put together in December of 2014 and has not been updated since the Forbes story was published. Since then, Uber has launched in more than 100+ cities internationally, therefore there is still a lot of work to be done to put together an up-to-date list of all the cities Uber is currently operating in.

Updates will be made perodically and pull requests will be accepted once they've been fact-checked.

## Source

Primary source of dates were from the now defunct blog.uber.com as well as corresponding local news articles.
